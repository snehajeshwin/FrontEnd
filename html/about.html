            During my tenure at Tata Communication Services as a Systems Engineer, I dedicated eight months to various 
            responsibilities. These encompassed the creation and implementation of manual test cases tailored for payroll systems. 
                
            My duties extended to meticulously documenting test outcomes using Jira. Actively engaging in team
            discussions and contributing proactively was a hallmark of my involvement. Collaborating closely with developers
            to address and rectify bugs was another integral aspect of my role. 
            Additionally, I proficiently conducted User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and regression tests to uphold software quality
            standards.

                I specialized in crafting and executing both manual and automated test cases for their mobile banking application. 
                Utilizing Seetest, I simulated mobile environments to ensure comprehensive testing coverage. My responsibilities 
                included conducting UI testing and diligently identifying and reporting potential bugs for resolution.

                    In my role involving mainframe testing within the Citibank credit cards domain, I contributed to
                    both manual and automated test case creation and execution. 
                    
                    I meticulously documented test cases, adhering to the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) framework.
                    I proficiently utilized a range of tools including ARD, ALM, and Jira for test case management, 
                    execution, and tracking. Additionally, I leveraged Bitbucket to publish work for future reference and
                    utilization by the company.
